# Assignment 1 - Java Programming

For this assignment, you will use Java and Eclipse to develop a program that implements
Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. 

The inputs to the algorithm will be supplied as command line arguments when the program is executed.

## Euclid's Algorithm 

Euclid's algorithm computes the greatest common divisor of two input positive integers. The greatest 
common divisor is the largest positive integer that divides evenly into both of the input values.

The algorithm uses the Definition of Division, which states that for any two integers a and b, there 
exist integers q and r such that a = q ( b ) + r.  In this representation, q is the quotient and r is the remainder.
